# Movie Theatre

A Movie Theatre terminal program that prompts the user for actions, \
such as displaying the theatre's layout, purchasing tickets, and \
printing financial statistics. The program first creates the theatre's \
size by receiving user input, then loops continuously, allowing the user \
to select the aforementioned options until they choose to end the program.
